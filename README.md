## Background

### The current block chain system such as Ethereum(https://etherscan.io/) can be built as next-generation block chain transaction system. But it is hard to be used into some private chain system atmosphere, such as company. We design a lightweight block chain scan system which can be used in company for light weight purpose.


## Install

```
git clone + link
node app.js (start the backend engine)
